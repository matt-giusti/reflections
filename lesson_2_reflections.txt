(Q1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

(A1)Initializing a repository creates a (hidden).git file which contains meta data about the history of the files in current directory and allows Git to track changes to the files.

(Q2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

(A1)The Staging Area provides an intermediary location to store files before committing changes. This is beneficial since it gives the user a chance to review which files are to be committed before making changes.
